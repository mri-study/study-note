# Introduction

## What are Data Structures?
- Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer, that can be used effectively.

## What is an algorithm?
- Set of steps to accomplish a task
- Set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task
    - input data -> calculation -> stop when answer found
- Sample algorithms that are used by big companies
    - How do Google and Facebook transmit live vide across the internet?
    - How to find shortest path on the map?
    - How to arrange solar panels on the International Space Station?
- What makes a good algorithm?
    - Correctness
    - Efficiency

## Why are Data Structures and Algorithms in interviews?
- problem solving skills
- fundamental concepts of programming in limited time


## Types of Data Structures
- Primitive
    - Integer
    - Float
    - Character
    - String
    - Boolean
- Non Primitive
    - Linear
        - Static
            - Array
        - Dynamic
            - Linked List
            - Stack
            - Queue
    - Non Linear
        - Tree
        - Graph


## Types of Algorithms
- Simple recursive algorithms
- Divide and conquer algorithms
    - Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type, and solve these subproblems recursively
    - Combine the solutions to the subproblems into a solution to the original problem
    - e.q.) Quick sort and merge sort 
- Dynamic programming algorithms
    - They work based on memoization
    - To find the best solution
- Greedy algorithms
    - We take the best we can without worrying about future consequences.
    - We hope that by choosing a local optimum solution at each step, we will end up at a global optimum solution
- Brute force algorithms
    - It simply tries all possibilities until a satisfactory solution is found
- Randomized algorithms
    - Use a random number a least once during the computation to make a decision
